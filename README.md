# Resources
* I did not use any resources outside of the lectures and my notes on this assignment.

# Deductions
* I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

# Comments
* Once again, another difficult assignment. My apologies Nick for emailing you so much, but even when trying to figure things out with a classmate we got stuck. I feel like the course is going way to fast and I wish we would've been taught to use the terminal, GitHub, and JavaScript at a slower pace or in a separate class (divide this class into two classes). Please let me know what things I can improve on. Thank you.

# Practice using `git pull`

Here's a small project that will let you test out using Git's [pull](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-pull) command.

## Setup

1. clone this project
2. `cd` into this project's directory
3. run `$ ./setup.sh`
4. use `$ git pull` to sync local repo with the remote one

You can run steps 3 and 4 as many times as you want.
